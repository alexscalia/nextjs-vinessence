Would you like me to update the code to support video backgrounds once you have the video files ready?
800x600 big enough? not better bigger? nextjs will resize anyway

You're absolutely right! For a professional wine importer website, larger dimensions would be much better. Next.js Image component will automatically:
Generate multiple responsive sizes
Serve WebP/AVIF formats when supported
Use appropriate size for each device
Lazy load for performance
Here are my updated recommended dimensions:
Content Images (larger & better quality):
Philosophy Section:
1200x900px (instead of 800x600)
French winemaker in cellar scene
Hospitality Section:
1400x800px (instead of 800x500)
Elegant restaurant interior
Boutique Wines Section:
1200x1000px (instead of 800x700)
Artisanal wine bottles arrangement
Why Larger is Better:
Retina/4K displays - Will look crisp on high-DPI screens
Cropping flexibility - More room to adjust focal points
Future-proofing - Ready for larger screen trends
Professional appearance - Sharp, detailed imagery befits a premium brand
File Size Management:
WebP format at 80-85% quality
Next.js will auto-generate smaller versions (400px, 800px, 1200px, etc.)
Only the appropriate size loads for each device
Still keep under 300-500KB per image
The larger source images will give you much better results across all devices while Next.js handles the optimization automatically!
